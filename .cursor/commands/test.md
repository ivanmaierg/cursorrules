# Test Generation Command

Generate comprehensive tests for the selected code including:

## Test Types:
- **Unit Tests**: Test individual functions and components in isolation
- **Integration Tests**: Test component interactions and data flow
- **Edge Cases**: Test boundary conditions and error scenarios
- **Accessibility Tests**: Verify ARIA labels, keyboard navigation, screen reader support
- **Performance Tests**: Test critical paths and performance metrics

## Testing Framework:
- Use React Testing Library for component testing
- Jest for unit tests and mocking
- Cypress or Playwright for end-to-end tests
- MSW for API mocking

## Test Structure:
- Arrange: Set up test data and mocks
- Act: Execute the function or user interaction
- Assert: Verify expected outcomes
- Cleanup: Reset state and mocks

## Coverage Goals:
- Aim for 80%+ code coverage
- Test all public methods and user interactions
- Include error handling and edge cases
- Verify accessibility compliance

Generate tests that are maintainable, readable, and provide confidence in the code quality.
