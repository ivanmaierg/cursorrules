# Refactor Code Command

Refactor the selected code to improve:
- **Performance**: Optimize algorithms, reduce re-renders, improve efficiency
- **Maintainability**: Extract reusable logic, improve naming, reduce complexity
- **Readability**: Improve structure, add comments, simplify logic
- **Type Safety**: Add proper TypeScript types and interfaces
- **Testability**: Improve dependency injection and modularity

## Focus Areas:
- Extract common patterns into reusable functions/components
- Simplify complex conditional logic
- Improve variable and function naming
- Add proper error handling
- Optimize performance bottlenecks
- Ensure code follows best practices

Keep the existing functionality intact while making the code cleaner, more maintainable, and more efficient.
