# Code Optimization Command

Optimize the selected code for:

## Performance Optimization:
- **Bundle Size**: Reduce JavaScript bundle size and improve loading times
- **Runtime Performance**: Optimize algorithms, reduce re-renders, improve efficiency
- **Memory Usage**: Minimize memory leaks and optimize resource usage
- **Database Queries**: Optimize queries, add proper indexing, reduce N+1 problems

## Specific Optimizations:
- Use React.memo() for expensive components
- Implement proper code splitting with dynamic imports
- Optimize images and assets
- Use proper caching strategies
- Implement lazy loading where appropriate
- Optimize database queries and API calls

## Metrics to Consider:
- First Contentful Paint (FCP)
- Largest Contentful Paint (LCP)
- Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS)
- Time to Interactive (TTI)
- Bundle size reduction
- Memory usage patterns

## Tools and Techniques:
- Webpack bundle analyzer
- React DevTools Profiler
- Lighthouse performance audits
- Database query optimization
- CDN implementation
- Service worker caching

Provide specific, actionable optimizations with measurable improvements and explain the impact of each change.
